# 📱 Average Daily Screen Time for Children – Python Project
This Python project analyzes screen time behaviors in children across different age groups, genders, and day types. Using Pandas, Matplotlib. I visualized key trends to better understand digital consumption patterns and promote healthier screen habits.

# 🎯 Project Goal
To visualize and analyze how screen time differs based on:
📅 Day type (Weekday vs Weekend)
🧒 Age group
🚻 Gender
📺 Screen time activity type (Entertainment, Social Media, Work)

# 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Environment: Jupyter Notebook

# 🧠 Skills Applied
Data Cleaning & Wrangling
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visual Storytelling with Subplots
Pattern Recognition in Behavior Analytics

# 📄 Summary
This project demonstrates how screen time usage varies by age, gender, and weekday/weekend behaviors. Key takeaways:
Screen time increases with age
Weekends see a spike in non-work-related digital use
Entertainment is the dominant activity
Gender-based variations emerge primarily on weekends
